This project presents an **interpretable, distributed drone coordination system** designed to operate under **unreliable communication networks.** The system avoids black-box learning and instead uses **rule-based, explainable decision-making** combined with **communication-aware coordination** and **sensor-based fallback.**

**Key Features**

* Distributed, decentralized drone coordination

* Explicit modeling of network delay and packet loss

* Interpretable decision logic with human-readable logs

* Sensor-based fallback when communication fails

* Task-based behavior (pickup and drop-off locations)

* Visualized drone movement (MP4 animations)

**Network Environments Simulated**

* V2X

* MQTT

* Urban

* Suburban

* Rural

**Metrics Evaluated**

* Message delivery rate

* Communication delay

* Collision count

* Sensor fallback usage

* Task completion

**Technologies**

* Python

* Matplotlib (visualization & animation)

* FFmpeg (video generation)

**How to Run**

* Open the notebook in Google Colab or locally.

* Install FFmpeg (if needed).

* Run the simulation cells to generate metrics and videos.
