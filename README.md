### The 3 Core Problems We Solve

| # | Problem | Why It Matters in Real World |
| --- | ------- | --------------------------- |
| 1 | How can agents communicate and coordinate when network is poor (urban congestion or rural coverage gaps)? | Without solution → collisions, inefficiency, unsafe behavior | 
| 2 | How can agents adapt their strategy to completely different environments (city vs. rural) while staying safe and efficient? | One-size-fits-all policies fail dramatically in mixed networks |
| 3 | How can we make RL decisions interpretable and trustworthy for humans/regulators? |
